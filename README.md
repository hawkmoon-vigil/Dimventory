# Dimventory
Dimension inventory add-on for Rift

Dimventory is an add-on for the MMORPG Rift that allows you to track inventory in player-made dimensions. As storage space is limited, a lot of players resort to storing their dimension items in warehouse dimensions. Thousands upon thousands of items can be added across multiple dimensions. The purpose of this addon is to have a single location in which to track those items for a particular account.

Features:
  - Two buttons added to the mini-map. one for adding/removing a dimension, and one to list items
  - Item filtering. Filter by Shard/Dimension, or by text.  Filtering supports lua find semantics with limited regular expressions
  - Cross-shard tracking and saving
  - Tracking and sorting of thousands of items
